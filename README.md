> Northcoders News API: A direct outcome of the Northcoders bootcamp, we've developed a news API that serves as middleware to programmatically access and deliver data from our application. Inspired by the backend architecture of robust platforms, our API has been meticulously designed to enable seamless integration with the frontend architecture, empowering efficient and structured presentation of information to end users.
